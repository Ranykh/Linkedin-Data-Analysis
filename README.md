LinkedIn Data Analysis
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that showcase an in-depth analysis of LinkedIn data. The analysis was conducted on Databricks, leveraging its robust distributed computing capabilities, PySpark integration, and advanced features for large-scale data processing.

The primary goal of this project was to extract valuable insights from LinkedIn data, which directly contributed to the development of An AI-based Tool for Career Recommendations via LinkedIn.

üìä Project Overview
üéØ Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze LinkedIn profiles and company data to identify patterns in employment, education, and industry distribution. The insights gained helped build a career recommendation tool that uses AI to suggest optimal career paths for LinkedIn users.

üìù Notebooks
Linkedin_dataAnalysis.ipynb:

Focused on processing LinkedIn user profile data.
Key tasks:
Analyzing user experiences across various companies.
Extracting educational background and job positions.
Cleaning and preprocessing profile text using NLP techniques.
Visualizations:
Bar plots of the most common words in profile sections.
Choropleth maps showing business mentions by U.S. states.
Linkedin_dataAnanlysis_2.ipynb:

Focused on LinkedIn company data.
Key tasks:
Identifying missing data patterns and classifying them (MCAR, MAR, MNAR).
Grouping companies into meta-industries.
Visualizations:
Heatmaps to visualize missing data patterns.
Clusters of companies based on similar attributes.
‚öôÔ∏è Tools and Technologies
Databricks:
A cloud-based platform that provides a collaborative environment for large-scale data analytics and machine learning.

PySpark:
Used for distributed data processing and SQL-like operations on structured data.

Pandas:
Utilized for small-scale data manipulation and visualization.

Matplotlib & Plotly:
Employed to create interactive visualizations, including bar plots and geographic maps.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):
Applied for text preprocessing, including tokenization and stopword removal, to analyze profile descriptions.

üí° Career Recommendation Tool
The insights derived from this LinkedIn data analysis project were used to build An AI-based Tool for Career Recommendations via LinkedIn. This tool uses AI to recommend personalized career paths based on a user‚Äôs LinkedIn profile data.

üìà Results and Insights
Profile Analysis
Identified key industries with the highest representation on LinkedIn.
Extracted and visualized the most frequently mentioned skills, job titles, and educational backgrounds.
Company Analysis
Grouped companies into meta-industries for better categorization.
Explored and visualized patterns of missing data, suggesting strategies for handling incomplete data during machine learning model training.
